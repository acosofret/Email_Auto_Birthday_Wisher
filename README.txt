To make the program run for you, follow the following steps:

1. Go to the letter_templates folder and customize the text of the 3 letters to suit your needs. Please leave [NAME]
 as it is, because that is what will be replaced by the actual name of the contacts.

2. Go to birthdays.csv file and edit it with your own contacts, following the original format. Add the name,
email and date of birth of all the contacts that you want to wish Happy Birthday messages during the year.

3. You'll need to modify the email and access password variables for your own email address, so the program gets access
to the email you'll send the mails from.
Most likely, the password will have to be a special passowrd generated from your email account so you allow
a 3rd party app (in this case, this python program) to access your email account - research how to do it for your own
provider on youtube.
Also, you'll have to update the connection to the email server for your own email provider.
(Details about where exactly to replace what - in the code).
